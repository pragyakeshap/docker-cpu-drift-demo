echo "🎯 CPU Drift Demo Summary"
echo "========================="
echo
echo "You now have a complete CPU drift demonstration!"
echo
echo "📦 Built Images:"
echo "  • cpu-drift:avx2    - Optimized for AVX2 CPUs"
echo "  • cpu-drift:baseline - Conservative, runs everywhere"
echo "  • cpu-drift:no-avx2  - Simulates old CPU (fails)"
echo
echo "🚀 Quick Demo:"
echo "  ./demo.sh"
echo
echo "🔍 Individual Tests:"
echo "  docker run --rm cpu-drift:avx2      # ✅ Works on modern CPUs"
echo "  docker run --rm cpu-drift:no-avx2   # ❌ Fails on old CPUs"
echo "  docker run --rm cpu-drift:baseline  # ✅ Works everywhere"
echo
echo "📖 Key Lessons:"
echo "  • Same image, different behavior on different CPUs"
echo "  • AVX2 provides 8x parallelism (256-bit vs 32-bit)"
echo "  • Older CPUs (pre-2013 Intel, pre-2015 AMD) lack AVX2"
echo "  • Always test on target deployment hardware!"
echo
echo "🎪 Perfect for demonstrating:"
echo "  • Why 'build once, run anywhere' isn't always true"
echo "  • The importance of CPU feature compatibility"
echo "  • How performance optimizations can break portability"
echo "  • Real-world deployment challenges"
